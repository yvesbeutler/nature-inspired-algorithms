\chapter{Introduction}

Since the beginning of our planet, nature has to deal with more or less complex
situations to guarantee the survival of its inhabitants. The key to success is to
accommodate best with the given environment and its circumstances. Since decades
men adapt techniques of nature's best performers to level up modern technology like
building planes according to the wing characteristics of birds or inventing new
adhesives by studying the feet of geckos\footnote{https://geckskin.umass.edu}.

We need to keep in mind, that nature spent million of years finding answers to survive
and failed at most of its attempts. But it didn't give up and adjusted certain parameters
to get better over time. So why should men don't profit from this millions of years
of research?
