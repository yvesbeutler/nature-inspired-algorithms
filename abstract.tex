In this term paper, I gave a brief introduction into nature-inspired algorithms
to solve various computational problems; this involves genetic algorithms which
strongly relate to the Darwinian evolutionary theory and its famous phrase of
the "survival of the fittest" as well as swarm algorithms and neural algorithms.
After a general overview about the different classes I selected multiple algorithms
for a deeper look at. I implemented a basic version of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT), a genetic algorithm to evolve Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
